# HW5_ThirdPartyAPIs
The fifth homework for the bootcamp, including the following features:
    WHEN I open the planner
    THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
    WHEN I scroll down
    THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
    WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
    THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
    WHEN I click into a timeblock
    THEN I can enter an event
    WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
    THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
    WHEN I refresh the page
    THEN the saved events persist
